# Expo AsyncStorage TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem')

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications and provides a solution.  The error, 'TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem')', arises from improper handling of AsyncStorage's asynchronous operations.

## Problem

The core problem lies in expecting AsyncStorage operations to complete synchronously.  AsyncStorage methods like `setItem`, `getItem`, etc., are asynchronous.  If your code continues executing before these operations finish, `AsyncStorage` might not be fully initialized, leading to the error.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that your code waits for the AsyncStorage operation to complete using `await` or `.then()`.  This guarantees that the subsequent operations are performed only after AsyncStorage has finished its task.
